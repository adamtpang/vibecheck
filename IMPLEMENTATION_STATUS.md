## ðŸ”„ NEXT PHASE: BACKEND & PERSISTENCE

### Immediate Next Steps

1. **Database Setup** (PostgreSQL + PostGIS)
   ```bash
   # Set up database with tables from VIBECHECK_ROADMAP.md
   - users table
   - vibes table (store audio features)
   - compatibility_scores table
   - vibe_shares table
   - notifications table
   ```

2. **Backend API Development** (Node.js/Express)
   ```bash
   # Create API endpoints
   /api/users - User management
   /api/vibes - Vibe analysis storage
   /api/compatibility - Calculate and cache compatibility scores
   /api/discovery - User discovery with location
   /api/share - Share tracking and analytics
   ```

3. **Data Persistence**
   - Store user vibe profiles in database
   - Cache compatibility scores for performance
   - Store audio features for offline analysis

### Advanced Features (Phase 3)

4. **Location-Based Matching**
   - Add location services integration
   - Implement radius-based discovery
   - Privacy controls for location sharing

5. **Notification System**
   - Real-time notifications for high compatibility matches
   - Location-based alerts
   - Share activity notifications

6. **Enhanced Analytics**
   - Music taste evolution over time
   - Compatibility trends
   - Genre clustering and recommendations
